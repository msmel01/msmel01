# Welcome 👋

My name is Melika, and I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Waterloo.

My current areas of interest are AI alignment and safety as well as human cognitive modelling and understanding.

In my free time, I like to go to the gym, learn French, or practice the drums. I'm also learning how to better manage my time and attention!

I'm open to collaborating or simply discussing any of these topics. Feel free to reach out and connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/melikamirsajjadi/).
